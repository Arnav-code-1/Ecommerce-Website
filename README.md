# EzShop

Hi! My name is **Arnav Rastogi**, I have created this Ecommerce Website EzShop to give users a better shopping experience.

This project is a simple e-commerce website featuring a static home page and a dynamic shop page. Users can browse and filter products, add them to a cart, and view real-time updates of their cart contents.

## Technologies Used

- CSS
- JavaScript
- Fetch API for dynamic data retrieval

## Setup
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser to view the home page.
3. Navigate to `shop.html` to interact with the shop page.
